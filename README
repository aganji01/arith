Files:
40image.c - compresses or decompresses an input file based on command line arg
a2plain.c - implements an array manipulation interfaed based on UArray2_T
BITPACK.C - allows for bitpacking which allows for inserting and extracting
unsigned and signed into 64 __BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__
chroma_processing - processes YPbPr images by breaking them into 2x2 blocks
manipulating chroma componenets, and reassembling the image
color_conversion - implements conversion between RGB colorspace and YPbPr 
colorspace
compress40.c -implements the compression and decompression functions for 
image_processing - write image data to files in both a compressed format and
 PPM format
 io - defines functions to write image data to files
 ppmdiff - checks if the 2 images are different and by how much
quantization - defines functions for quantizing and packing coefficients 
into codewords and unpacks them and dequantizing them
transform - implements functions to perform discrete cosine transform and 
the inverse on image data,
uarray2.c - implement 2 dimensional array structure
